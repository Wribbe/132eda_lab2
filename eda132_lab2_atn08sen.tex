  \section*{Introduction}

    The following assignment task is to locate, as precisely as possible, the
    discrete x- and y-coordinates of a hidden robot in a (X,Y)-sized
    grid-world, using the robots faulty sensor. \\

    It is known that the robot orients itself according to the following
    probabilities:
    \begin{align*}
      P(\textrm{Keep orientation | Facing wall}) &= 0.0 \\
      P(\textrm{Keep orientation | Not facing wall}) &= 0.7 \\
      P(\textrm{Keep orientation | Not facing wall}) &= 0.3
    \end{align*}

    There is also a known distribution for the readings of the faulty sensor:
    \begin{align*}
      P(\textrm{True position}) &= 0.1 \\
      P(\textrm{1-step-off}) &= 0.05 \cdot np1\\
      P(\textrm{2-step-off}) &= 0.025 \cdot np2\\
      P(\textrm{Nothing}) &= 1.0-\Sigma P(\textrm{\{True,1-,2-off\}})
    \end{align*}

    Where $np1$ and $np2$ are the number of possible (inside the grid)
    positions one and two steps from the robots true location respectively.
    Additionally the assumptions that the robot always successfully moves one
    tile and stays inside the grid are made.
